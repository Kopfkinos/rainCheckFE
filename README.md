# Welcome to rainCheck 🌧️☂️

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## What is rainCheck? 

Ever made plans with a friend, only to feel the creeping dread of social obligation as the date approaches? You don’t really want to cancel in case they’re still keen—but what if they’re also secretly hoping you’ll flake first? Suddenly, you’re both trapped in a standoff of stiff upper lips, heading to an event neither of you truly wants to attend. Enter our event-cancelling app: a discreet escape hatch for the anxious-avoidant. Our app lets users quietly check if their friend is also thinking about bailing. No awkward messages, no guilt-laced apologies—just a discreet button that only reveals your intention to cancel if the other person feels the same. 

## How Does It Work? 

The app is designed to be simple and to the point, with a sprinkling of visual flare, style and copy to match the slightly tongue-in-cheek USP. Users can log in, create and browse events, and invite another user to an event. Every event page contains the event details as well as a “Not Feelin’ It” button. If a user presses this button, the backend will register that they no longer wish to attend the event. Only if both users have pressed the button, will the event page instead display a "Both Not Feeling It" page. 

Here's a link to the backend [repo](https://github.com/SohrabYavari/rain-check-be) and the [hosted API](rain-check-be.onrender.com/api)!
